             <h4 class="privacy-heading">2. Important Information about the Services and InvestFar, Inc</h4>
             <strong>Scope and Limitation of Services</strong>
             <p>The Services provide a technology platform that functions as a marketplace and database with a forum to allow real estate enthusiasts to connect and communicate with one another.  The Services allow users to establish contacts, make inquiries and receive information and education about real estate and related business opportunities.</p>

             <p>Access to the Services is provided to users who agree to pay applicable subscription fees.  InvestFar, Inc is not involved in negotiating, and is not compensated for any real estate or other transactions that arise out of interactions between users of the Services. </p>
 
             <p>We are not a licensed real estate agent, a registered broker-dealer, or a licensed investment adviser, and we do  not provide any kind of advice, including but not limited to tax advice, legal advice, accounting advice, or investment advice. </p>

             <p> The Services are not provided to, and may not be used by, any user in a jurisdiction where they would be illegal, or where InvestFar, Inc is not authorized to provide Services.</p>
             <strong>Use and Restrictions Related to the Services</strong>
             <p>You should not use the Services to execute any documents or instruments, or to make any offers or proposals that you intend to be legally binding. The functionality of the Services might not be technically adequate to support legally binding contracts.</p>
             <p>If you post content that may be viewed as an offer of real estate or securities or as investment advice or recommendation, you do so at your own risk and with an implied representation and warranty to us that you are complying with all applicable laws. If we incur any damages as a result of your failure to comply with all laws, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees, you will be responsible.</p>
             <p>Conversely, if other users post content that may be viewed as an offer of real estate or securities or as investment advice or recommendation, you acknowledge that the offer, advice, or recommendation comes solely from the other user, and not from InvestFar, Inc. We do not vouch for or verify any information posted by users and you proceed at your own risk.</p>
             <p>We are not responsible for User Content (as defined in Section 15) or for any losses you incur dealing with other users.</p>
             <strong>Investment Warnings</strong>
             <p>We may from time to time list investment opportunities on the Site, including but not limited to links from other websites. However, we do not make recommendations regarding the appropriateness of particular opportunity for any particular investor. We are not investment advisers. Users of the Site must make their own investment decisions, either alone or with their personal advisors. You acknowledge that you are not relying on us in making investment decisions.</p>
             <p>Real estate is notoriously speculative and unpredictable. For example, many very experienced, very informed people lost money when the real estate market declined in 2007 through 2008. When the real estate market is healthy, as it was from 2003 through 2006, it appears that it will be healthy forever, but time after time history has shown that the real estate market goes down without warning, sometimes resulting in devastating losses. You should invest in real estate in general, and in opportunities listed at the Site in particular, only if you can afford to lose your investment and are willing to live with the ups and downs of the real estate industry.</p>

<p>You and company agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to this website terms of use or related products or services shall be finally decided by binding arbitration under the rules of the american arbitration association governing consumer disputes. Arbitration uses a single, neutral arbitrator to decide a dispute (instead of a judge or jury); arbitration allows for more limited discovery than in a court case; and the arbitration process and result is subject to very limited review by courts. In arbitration you have the right, at your expense, to be represented by an attorney of your choosing. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief under this eula that a court can award under this eula. You and company agree that any in-person arbitral hearing would occur in the same county and state as your billing address. Company further agrees that your filing fee for arbitration will be capped at the amount set by the american arbitration association. You agree that, by agreeing to this eula, the u.S. Federal arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this eula and the termination of your use of the mobile mail. Regardless of the forum, you and company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.</p>

In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month.

<p>7.1. If you are a InvestFar member in the United States (including its possessions and territories), you and InvestFar agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the service, these Terms of Use and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting any non-waivable statutory rights. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and InvestFar are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your InvestFar membership.</p>
